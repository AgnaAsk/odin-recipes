        <h1>Blueberry Pie</h1>

        <h2>About this dish</h2>
        <p>This slightly updated recipe produces a better-than-ever blueberry pie. Reader reviews reporting 
            a soupy, runny filling inspired me to rework the baking instructions on my original 2016 recipe 
            and make a slight change to the filling ingredients. My team and I tested a LOT of blueberry 
            pies in the last few weeks. We searched for the magic trick to a perfectly flavorful, non-runny 
            blueberry pie.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8–9 large apples, cored, peeled, and sliced into 1/4-inch slices (11–12 cups, or 1375–1500g total)*</li>
            <li>6 cups (3 pints; 900g) fresh blueberries*</li>
            <li>2/3 cup (135g) granulated sugar*</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (31g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons (14g) cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon (14g) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tablespoon (15ml) milk</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the filling: Stir the blueberries, sugar, flour, cornstarch, cinnamon, lemon juice, 
                and lemon zest together in a large bowl. Mix together until it’s no longer dry and 
                powdery; burst a few blueberries if necessary to moisten. Set filling aside as the oven 
                preheats. Filling can be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours if needed.</li>
            <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat to 425°F (218°C). Place 
                baking sheet on the bottom oven rack to catch any blueberry juices.</li>
            <li>Roll out the chilled pie dough: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the discs of 
                chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator). Turn the dough about a quarter 
                turn after every few rolls until you have a circle 12 inches in diameter. Carefully 
                place the dough into a 9×2-inch round pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making 
                sure it is smooth. Pour and spread filling evenly into pie dish. Dot the pieces of 
                butter on top of the filling. Set aside at room temperature or in the refrigerator as 
                you assemble the top pie crust.</li>
            <li>Arrange the lattice: Remove the other disc of chilled pie dough from the refrigerator. 
                Roll the dough into a circle that is 12 inches diameter. Using a pastry wheel, sharp 
                knife, or pizza cutter, cut strips of dough; in the pictured pie, I cut 10 1.5-inch-wide 
                strips. Carefully thread the strips over and under one another, pulling back strips as 
                necessary to weave. (Here’s a lattice pie crust tutorial if you need visuals.) Press the 
                edges of the strips into the bottom pie crust edges to seal. Use a small paring knife to 
                trim off excess dough. Flute or crimp the edges with a fork.</li>
            <li>Lightly brush the top of the pie crust with the egg wash. Sprinkle the top with coarse sugar, 
                if using.</li>
            <li>Remove pie from the oven, place on a cooling rack, and cool for at least 4 hours before slicing 
                and serving. Filling will be too juicy if the pie is warm when you slice it.</li>
